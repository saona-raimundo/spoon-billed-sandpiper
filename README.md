Numerical approximation of expected polymorphisms, aka heterozygosity, for a model of random selection.

## Structure

- `main.pdf` explains the model and the script. 
- `results.csv` contains the numerical results.
- `script.wasm` is a command line application to get more numerical approximations. 
- `latex` contains the source files for `main.pdf`. 
	- `main.tex` is the LaTeX source file for `main.pdf`.
	- `refs.bib` it the BibTeX source file for `main.pdf`.
- `script` contains the source code for numerical approximations.
